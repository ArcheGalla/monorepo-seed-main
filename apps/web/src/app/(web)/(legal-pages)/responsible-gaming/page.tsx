          <h2>PLAYER EDUCATION</h2>

          <h3>Understanding Odds and Random Number Generation</h3>
          <p>
            All Vegas Bonanza games use Random Number Generators (RNGs) to
            determine game outcomes. This means:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Each spin, deal, or play is independent of previous outcomes
            </li>
            <li>Past results do not influence future outcomes</li>
            <li>There are no &quot;hot&quot; or &quot;cold&quot; machines</li>
            <li>No strategy can predict or influence the RNG</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Virtual Currency vs. Real Money</h3>
          <p>We want to remind our players that:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Vegas Bonanza uses two types of virtual currency:
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Gold Coins: Used for gameplay only and have no real-world
                  monetary value
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sweepstakes Coins: Used to enter sweepstakes and have no
                  real-world monetary value
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              Neither type of virtual currency can be exchanged for cash or
              real-world items
            </li>
            <li>
              Purchasing Gold Coins does not improve your chances of winning in
              our games
            </li>
            <li>
              Success at our social casino games does not indicate potential
              success at real-money gambling
